# User Experience (UX) 

<br>

## Initial Discussion
&nbsp;  
Radstone Farm Livery Stables is a website designed to showcase their facilities and services to potential clients.  The site consists of a home page highlighting the services and facilites at the stables as well as an about section.  It also contains a facilities page and also a contact page. 

<br>

### Site goals

<br>
The goal of the website is to allow potential users of the stables to take a look at the premises, find information about the stable facilities such as the riding school and tack room as well as see what services the stables provide. The users will be able to see the livery packages offered, their prices and also be able to contact the stables should they wish to.  The site needs to be accessible on various devices, easy to navigate and visually appealing.

<br>

## Design

<br>

### Colour Scheme
<br>
The color scheme that I dediced upon were earthy brown, green, and cream.  These are the type of colours that are seen in the equine industry.  Originally the colours that were going to be used were quite bold and vibrant but it became apparent as I was building the site that a more muted, pastel version of the colours worked better.

<br>

### Typography

<br>

The fonts for this project were imported from Google Fonts (link in credits).  The fonts chosen were libre-baskerville for the main text on the site, Lato for the headings and Oswald for the small titles. 
 All three of these fonts are easy to read and spaced nicely.

### Imagery

<br>

The pictures used fot his site were sourced from online websites that offer free images (these are listed in the credits section). 

The images were resized using Photoshop and compressed with Tiny PNG in order to reduce loading time.
